It might come as a surprise to some of you, but we just shielded our Reflect server website behind an instance of the trustworthy Nginx. Not that Reflect server needed a performance boost (it should happily withstand the comparison with Nginx actually). Reflect was nicely handling things like compression, tls encryption (although without any automatic upgrade which lead to connection errors when typing pytek.io name directly in a browser address bar). The only issue was that it felt like putting too much responsibility on Reflect shoulders, especially given that they are battle tested solutions readily available. So we stripped down Reflect from Internet functionalities, with the feeling of doing the right thing. And, I was about to forget to mention, as an additional bonus our website is no longer at the mercy of any wannabe hacker... ;-)
