Code formatters use is now fairly common nowadays. They not only settle arguments over formatting styles (you can't argue with a machine), but they free your mind from bothering about the way things look. In a way they make the coding a bit more abstract. The other obvious benefit is that reading code consistently formatted is a bit easier even though it might exactly look like how you have formatted it manually. So if you don't use a code formatter, make yourself a favor install one (as well as a spell checker) and never worry any more about.
They do a pretty decent job at presenting nicely and even more importantly consistently code.
