As in many other circumstances choosing an appropriate name is a crucial matter. It is all the more critical than a well engineered program can be described as a structured and meaningful way to explain what to do to a computer. Following principles such as: [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), etc will definitely help structuring things. The true acid test is how easy is it to find a descriptive name that will clearly convey the intent of a given part of the code. My personal stance is to use the appropriate casing (snake, Camel, etc) given the context, never abbreviate anything, and never use more than a couple of words together. Even when things are perfectly structured finding the right name can take several attempts. Quite often I might rename a few things when understanding an old piece of code, so that it feels perfectly well described. Of good programming good much deeper than proper naming - I shall come back to that a few times in the future - but still I find it usually a good indicator of the overall quality of a given piece of software.
