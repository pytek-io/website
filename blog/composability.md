One of the key aspects of writing code is organizing in a well structured manner that makes it easy to read and duplication free. The latter point is hopefully a given to everyone, but it is usefull to stress out its importance nevertheless. To quote Bill Gates "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.”. In this metaphore duplication is equivalent to add dead weight out of sheer slopiness. My stance on this is that the easiest way to prevent it is simply never let it happen in the first place. If the cost of avoiding duplication is too high this might be the sign that you either use a broken programming language or you don't master it well enough. This obvious point out of the way lets describe what makes a good code structure. A rather non controversial way to describe a good structure would be say that functionalities shoud be strictly layered from what users want to what the computer understand.
