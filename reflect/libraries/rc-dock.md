[rc-dock](https://github.com/ticlo/rc-dock) is a powerful React Dock Layout manager. It allows users to customize dashboard applications to their exact needs by resizing and moving around windows. Unless have you already used a dock manager in an application (eg: Visual Studio, Eclipse, ...) we `:mark:highly recommend` taking a look at the [demo](https://ticlo.github.io/rc-dock/) to avoid any confusion. You can see this component being used in [generic dashboard](internal:website.reflect.gallery/demos.dashboard.dashboard) and [grid computing UI](internal:website.reflect.gallery/demos.dispatch.main) demos.

```load_module
