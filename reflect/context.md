## Python cannot be easily used for business purposes out of the box

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is arguably the [most popular](https://linuxiac.com/python-the-most-popular-programming-language/) programming language in the world. It has become the de facto standard in many domains such as scientific computing, finance, AI/ML, etc. Despite its intrinsic qualities its adoption in the enterprise world has been slowed down by the fact that it does not have a standard enterprise framework contrary to [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) or [Java](https://spring.io/). In particular, common needs such as user interface generation or apps deployment still require a serious amount of engineering efforts.

## Single-page apps are complex to develop

[Single-page apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (aka web app, SPA) are interactive web pages written in Javascript (e.g. webmail client, Google docs, etc). They are now a strong alternative to traditional [desktop applications](https://www.seguetech.com/desktop-vs-web-applications/). However developing any advanced web apps still remains technically challenging. There are readily available open source frameworks such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [NextJs](https://nextjs.org), etc or "low code" commercial solutions to develop web apps which all use JavaScript on the server side. This approach works reasonably well for simple use cases such as reading or writing data, but anything beyond that quickly becomes orders of magnitude harder than using a general purpose programming language such as Python.

## In-house Python enterprise frameworks are great but expensive

In order to address the challenges mentioned above, the largest financial institutions have developed platforms allowing thousands of developers to work together effectively. Those platforms turned out to be very effective not only at drastically reducing effort duplication but also at providing an industrial framework in which to develop and operate hundreds of applications seamlessly. In practice those platforms provide a handful of well integrated pieces of technologies (UI, DB, scheduler, computing grid, etc) on top of which developers can easily build applications. These platforms took vast amounts of efforts to build, and are still very expensive to operate and evolve. They require dedicated "core" teams which can run into the dozens of people for the largest.
