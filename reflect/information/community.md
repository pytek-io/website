We are building a community around the Reflect project. Here are the main types of contribution we are mostly interested in.

### App developer

Whether you are a seasoned professional or an enthusiastic Python developer, join our pioneering community. Install Reflect for free and build awesome apps! Ask for help and share your experiences on [slack](https://pytekgroup.slack.com/archives/C02NKLL5T47).

### Core developer

Our framework foundations are now in place, but there is still a huge amount we want to achieve. The aim is no less than to build the best Python enterprise framework in the world, so if you have any technical skills (TypeScript, CSS, Python, Rust) and want to be a part of this crazily ambitious endeavour, then please reach out to [us](mailto:francois@pytek.io)!

### Content creator

You like to communicate? We would really welcome your contribution to our documentation, blog, communication on various social networks, etc. Feel free to edit the pages. We very much see documentation as a key aspect of any piece of technology.

### Other than that

Spread the word! The best way your can help us is by introducing us to the rest of the world.
