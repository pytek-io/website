The commercial solutions listed below all allow business apps to be build in Python. They offer fully integrated systems, making them attractive out-of-the-box solutions.
Reflect, on the other hand, having an intrinsically open architecture, offers a more versatile solution for building business apps, that can seamlessly integrate with other existing systems. This approach enables a smooth adoption curve and provides a development framework suited to the simplest as well as the most advanced business apps.

### Beacon

[Beacon](https://www.beacon.io/) was founded by the former lead developer of the JPM and BAML main technical platforms. Its main design is therefore very much inspired by these. It comes with a fully working data model, as well as analytics libraries that can be used for trading activities. In particular, it uses heavily a dependency graph which is used not only to drive UIs, but also to store and retrieve data, as well as to implement complex financial computations.

#### You might prefer Beacon if you need

- A very tightly integrated complete technical stack ready to be used.
- To use a similar framework to these used in major US Banks.

#### You might prefer Reflect if you need

- To improve an existing Python system while minimizing the amount of wasted development effort.
- A lightweight enterprise framework allowing you to build apps efficiently, whilst integrating the technologies of your choice.

### Odoo

[Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) provides a general purpose Python enterprise framework. Its main technology allows to define UI's in XML. It also works with numerous third party technologies and comes with a huge ecosystem of apps developed on top. These make Odoo quite an attractive ERP solution for SMEs.

#### You might prefer Odoo if you need

- A set of well integrated proprietary technologies (ORM, MVC, template engines, etc) offering a full stack solution.
- An open architecture which allows fine grain customization systems through ad hoc plugins and in-house development.

#### You might prefer Reflect if you need

- To build systems (re)using you preferred database management system, etc
- To build highly interactive apps in a modern Python style

### Anvil

[Anvil](https://anvil.works/) provides a very complete and well integrated framework for the very quick building of web apps. They took a rather unusual approach by using [Skulpt](http://skulpt.org/). This allows developers to write the front-end code entirely in Python with minimal knowledge of web technologies.

#### You might prefer Anvil if you need

- A nicely integrated IDE allowing UIs to be built using drag and drop interface with a set of basic components
- A very complete infrastructure allowing the deployment and operation of apps at scale

#### You might prefer Reflect if you need

- To get full access to the API's of commonly used React libraries
- To leverage an elegant callback free API in order to design advanced business apps
