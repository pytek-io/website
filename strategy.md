git a# Internal software development

By internal software develpment we mean any software developed and used internally by a company. Internal software development typically emcompass the following tasks:
* Understanding end users requirements 
* Turn those requirements into code. 
* Tests new changes are not breaking existing functionalities.
* Deploy those changes on the relevant hardware.
* Support the hardware

We are aiming to disrupt the in house internal software development by providing a application platform solving the most common technical problems. Thoe

can be described as explaing to the machine what end users want. As a result many companies become unwittling 

This translation exercise can be seriously complicated by the technical aspects

# The problem are we solving.

More and more companies, especially in the finance industry - but not exclusively develop software systems for internal use. It ranges from simple tasks automation to building large technical platforms running hundreds of business applications. Technologies have vastly improved in mostly three areas:
* Python has became not only the standard for data sciences but also the most commonly taught programming language. Its simplicity and huge ecosystem make it the ideal language for coding business applications.
* Web technologies have vastly improved allowing to build advanced user interfaces running seamlessly on any modern browser.
* Cloud technologies allow to operate large arrays of computers cheaply.

The combination of those technologies is referred to as a technical stack. To be usable in anger this particular technical stack still requires a significant amount of engineering efforts. Although those kinds of development are critical for developing and operating business applications they are by not means business specific. They seriously complicate the task of every IT team which has to operate and but also improve existing systems. A few of the largest organizations have dedicated teams working on building technical stacks. Those have allowed organizations to successfully build common platform applications used by thousands of developers. Other organizations cannot afford such efforts and are therefore stuck in a much more fragmented situation in many respects. 


# Which solution do we provide?

We aim to provide a complete application platform allowing to use those technologies together seamlessly. It will fill the gaps between those technologes as well as provide state of the art solutions to common issues such as integration, deployment, etc.
