Can Reflect be used as a CMS?
Reflect does not offer the same level of functionality as a CMS. That being said as you might have guess this website is a Reflect app. It would definitely makes sense to use Reflect for exposing complex functionality/services to professional (eg:  financial derivatives product, advanced data access, ...)

How does Reflect compares to traditional web technologies?
By and large current web technologies returns content (mostly html but not only) based on the request submitted (browser address bar but not only). This is extremely flexible and highly scalable but does not offer the same level of interactivity than proper applications. The two common way to allow for some interactivity are the rest architecture, and embedding JavaScript code in webpages. Rest architecture is are address based protocols in which web clients pass highly descriptive addresses to servers which  return content accordingly.

The fundamental difference with traditional web technology is that it works in a fully connected mode. We will add a reconnection mechanism to allow for disconnections but this will remain a fundamental requirement even though. 
The second major difference is that everything is canned allowing for a very smooth developer experience but at the expense of flexibility. You can leverage the entire power of CSS technology which should allow for a great deal of customization, but you might want to use more standard architectures if you aim for highly bespoke user experience.
